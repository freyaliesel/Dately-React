## Description

Dately is a web application that provides local event and restaurant information. Data is retrieved based on a date and a Chicago neighborhood location, which is provided by the user. After searching, a user can "like" events and restaurants and save to a "bucket list" for future reference.

## Development

[Dately Repo](https://github.com/GitGals/Dately)  
[Dately Live App](https://gitgals.github.io/Dately/)

The original Dately app was built using static web pages and vanilla javascript.  

This version of the project is being rebuilt as a full stack React application to be hosted on Heroku.  

This is a work in progress.
